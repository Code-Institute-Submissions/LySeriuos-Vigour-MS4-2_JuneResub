Having run a 2:10 marathon (5min per mile!) and finished in the top of major marathons from London to Berlin to New York City, Ryan has grown to live, love and excel at the marathon lifestyle. Having raced for the United States at the World Cross Country Championship, a race many consider the most competitive in the world, on five separate occasions, Ryan has shown that despite the conditions, from thick mud and rain to intense heat and humidity, he always delivers. Ryan is passionate about bringing what he’s learned about running, preparation and competition from around the world, to athletes of all paces and races. Having seen it all and risen to the test, Ryan aims to help others love the lifestyle that had given him so much success.",

And that adventure continues even today! In 2007, yoga moved from being a cherished side aspect of my life, to being its center. Since then, many years have been dedicated to classical hatha & yin yoga practice & studies, to meditation, contemplation & retreats, and to investigation into the essence of life. My hatha yoga & meditation practice is inspired by krishnamacharya's vinyasa krama, and i am moved by the pointing of mooji, that profoundly pulls the yoga teachings off the mat into a moment by moment inquiry.",

Numerous studies in behavior change have shown that it takes an average of 66 days to form one new habit.
